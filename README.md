# gemini-project
üß† its_ok_gemini

A lightweight API-based project built with Python that processes JSON POST requests, runs on a Dockerized environment, and uses environment variables for configuration. The project is designed for flexibility and deployment readiness.

üìã Summary

its_ok_gemini is a Python web service designed to handle JSON-based POST requests efficiently.
It‚Äôs containerized using Docker for smooth deployment and portability.
The environment configuration is handled securely through an env.txt file.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/its_ok_gemini.git
cd its_ok_gemini

2. Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file or rename env.txt ‚Üí .env, then add your credentials and keys (for example):

API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEBUG=True
PORT=5000

üê≥ Run with Docker

If you prefer containerization:

docker build -t its_ok_gemini .
docker run -p 5000:5000 its_ok_gemini

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The project expects JSON POST requests.
You can test it using curl or any API client (like Postman).

Example:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/analyze \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Hello Gemini"}'


Check the file json-post-requests.txt for more sample inputs.

üß© Code Explanation
main.py

Loads environment variables.

Sets up a lightweight server (likely using Flask or FastAPI).

Handles POST requests from clients.

Returns JSON responses with the processed or analyzed data.

requirements.txt

Lists all dependencies needed to run the project.
Install them with pip install -r requirements.txt.

Dockerfile

Defines how to build the Docker image ‚Äî installs dependencies, copies code, and runs the app.

env.txt

Contains configurable environment variables (rename to .env before running).

üß™ Example Workflow

Start the app locally or in Docker.

Send a JSON POST request to your endpoint.

Receive and parse the JSON response.

This setup is ideal for API testing, automation tools, or lightweight AI endpoints.
